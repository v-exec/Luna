Ariena is a traditional piece I drew a year ago of an original character I came up with as a kid, this was the first coloured pencil drawing I did that I was actually proud of. I decided to re-draw it this year in order to see how much progress I’ve made and how much I’ve learnt during this time. I believe that the piece reflects my learning process and shows just how far dedication and hard work can get you.

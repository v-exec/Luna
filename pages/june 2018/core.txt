Core is a reactor isolated in a completely sterile environment stored away from the elements, made evident by the polished coating on its rings. The goal of this venture was to create a device capable of harnessing and processing the energy of rare metals. Its casing is made up of a highly reflective material meant to contain the light rays emitted from the core when operational. When in motion, the rings spin at high-speeds in order to amplify the energy emitted from the core. That energy would then be transferred outside its own shell. It is the process of energy creation.

This work drew a lot of inspiration from some of the early sci-fi movies like "2001: A space odyssey". The goal was to re-imagine some of the technologies that we currently have and propose a new alternative on how they could look.

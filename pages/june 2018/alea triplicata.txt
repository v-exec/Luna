Alea Triplicata, otherwise known as the "hazardous cube", is a self replicating mechanical cell organism. It simultaneously shapes itself and seeks to connect with other neighboring cells. The piece in question portrays the Alea in its own process of self-replication through 3 stages, the mechanism, the construction and the completion.

Its shape is chaotic, geometric and random at large, similar to a tumour in some ways. Contrary to actual living cells, the Alea Triplicata forms its shell first and then its "nucleus" later. It does not separate itself in the conventional cell cycle. When most of the outer shell is formed, the shell, in turn, emits tendrils from the inside that are attracted to the center of cell.

In this summer, I took my 4th trip to Japan. Unlike all my previous trips to the country, I ended up stopping by Tokyo and had the opportunity purchase a solid film camera thanks to a friend. What I quickly noticed was the difference in colors between film and digital photography. Notably, I found myself thinking that film was far more superior for obtaining vivid colors and highlights which also made me wonder why consumers/photographers discarded it completely in the first place.

Colors of Fukuoka is a re-examination of very iconic districts in the city through the lens of film photography. Each frame was taken in one of Fukuoka's many districts and features a particular aspect that I like about it. This project is an attempt at revisiting the city and expressing its uniqueness.

Silence of stones is a set of imagined environments set in a cyberpunk universe where man's consumption comes at a price. The idea was to represent silence as a luxury that only few can possess. As advertisements become noisier, and cities become more crowded, many would pay a dear price to rekindle with their natural environment.

The environments themselves are set in an underground cave network with simple motifs and textures, occasionally illuminated by natural sunlight. The architects figured that building the network underground would reduce the likelihood of outside noise interference. Each "room" in the network is different from the next, made to represent the different nuances of previously extinct biomes.
